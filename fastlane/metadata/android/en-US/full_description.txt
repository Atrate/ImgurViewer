ImgurViewer is a little image viewer to open image links from external applications in the fastest
way possible.

As the name suggests it was originally designed to open Imgur image links, but the application
evolved to support some other images services too, the current image services supported are:

Imgur: with full support ( galleries, albums, gif videos, simple image links ). Gif links will be
opened as videos to save bandwidth and faster loading.

Gyazo: full image support.
Gfycat: full Gfycat videos. As Imgur, it will load videos instead of gifs when possible.
i.reddituploads.com support.
streamable.com support.
twitch clips support.
Instagram image, video, and simple profile image gallery support.
vid.me support.
flickr support.
GIPHY support.
And many more services.

Also, ImgurViewer can open any link with a path with an image extension, so, it will try to handle
any image or video link.
